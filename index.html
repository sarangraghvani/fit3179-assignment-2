                <h3>What Is The Size Of Different Economies?</h3>

                     <br>Around the world, some countries have large economies and others are smaller. So how can we measure and
                     compare them to <span>Australia</span>? <br><br>Well the <b>Gross domestic product (GDP)</b> is a universally accepted 
                     metric. It is simply a monetary measure of the market value of of all fiscal goods and services traded in each 
                     financial year. So it is calculated as the sum of consumption by households, investment by businesses, 
                     government spending on goods and services and net exports.<br><br> But if we simply use this <b>GDP</b> to compare 
                     countries around the world, then countries with high populations such as China and the US would be shown 
                     disproportionately as compared to smaller countries like <span>Australia</span>. So a non-trivial solution 
                     is to <b>normalise</b> the GDP with the population. This is called the <b>GDP per Capita</b>.<br><br> From the map we can 
                     see that <span>Australia's </span> <b>GDP per Capita</b> is relatively high as is the case with many other developed 
                     economies such as the US, Canada and New Zealand. This means that generally <span>Australian's </span> currently 
                     have good <b>purchasing</b> power and are relatively wealthy today. Has this always been the case throughout history?

                        Looking through <b>GDP per capita</b> over time from 1960 back when <b>Sir Robert Menzies</b> the Prime Minister, to 2021 
                        today, we can see that generally over time, comparable countries have <b>increased</b> the size of their respective economies as 
                        has <span>Australia </span>. <br><br>Back then <span>Australia's </span> <b>GDP per capita</b> was <b>$1,811</b> and now it is
                        upto almost a whopping <b>$60,000!</b> <br><br> However <b>GDP growth</b> is not steady but is rather cyclical in nature.
                        Economies boom then recessions follow and this cycle repeats. From the year 1995 to 2000 there was the <b>Dot 
                        Com Bubble</b> and in 2008 there was the <b>Global Financial Crisis</b> which saw all major economies contract. <br>
                        <br> While other countries have gone through many recessions, <span>Australia </span> didn't have a recession 
                        for almost <b>30 years</b> until now. This proves that <span>Australia's </span> economy is resilient even in bad 
                        times and Infact, there was a time when it had the <b>highest GDP per capita</b> among these nations. <br><br>So why is 
                        <span>Australia's </span>economy so resiliant? It must be something to do with the <b>community</b>.

                     <br>A country and its <b>society</b> is generally more prosperous when <b>corruption is low</b> and <b>unemployment is low</b>. This underpins an efficient 
                     and strong economy. <br><br>We can see that countries that have <b>low corruption levels</b> and an <b>low unemployments</b> have greater <b>GDP per capitas</b>.
                     <br><br><span>Australia </span> has a <b>corruption index of 27</b> and an <b>unemployment of 5%</b> and thus has a <b>high GDP per capita</b>. This is also 
                     true for places like the US and Western Europe. <br><br>
                     Overall, the pattern is obvious and therefore we can see that to improve a countries economic postion, their respective governments

                  Looking within <span>Australia's </span> economy, so how can we see which state or territory is overperforming and which is dragging the 
                  economy down? <br><br>We can observe the proportion of <b>gross state products</b> contributing to the overall countries <b>GDP</b>, and compare that

                  to upwards of <b>20% of GDP</b>. <br><br>WA is outperforming other states due to its strong <b>mining industry</b>, which has strong growth
                  of <b>4.1%</b> year on year. Looking at other industries, the <b>IT, science and healthcare</b> sector have the most

                  growth and thus other states such as Vic and NSW can look to those industries in an attempt to increase their <b>economic output</b>. <br><br>
                  Overall, <span>Australia's </span>economy is very strong and their population do reap the benefits, infact throughout the countries
